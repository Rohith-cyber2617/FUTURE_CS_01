# Finding 03 – Insecure Session Cookie Configuration

## Observation
A session cookie named "login" was identified without critical security flags.

Cookie Details:
- Name: login
- Secure Flag: Not Enabled
- HttpOnly Flag: Not Enabled
- SameSite Attribute: Not Set
- Protocol: HTTP (Not Encrypted)

---

## Risk Explanation (Business Perspective)

Improper cookie configuration increases exposure to:

- Session hijacking attacks
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) interception
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) exploitation
- Unauthorized session reuse

Without the Secure flag, cookies can be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections.

Without HttpOnly, malicious scripts can access session cookies.

Without SameSite, cross-site request forgery (CSRF) risks increase.

This directly impacts user account security and data confidentiality.

---

## Risk Level
High

(Session management weaknesses are a major web security concern.)

---

## Recommended Remediation

- Enforce HTTPS across the entire website
- Enable Secure flag on all session cookies
- Enable HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access
- Configure SameSite=Strict or Lax
- Implement secure session timeout policies
