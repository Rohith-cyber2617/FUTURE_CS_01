# Finding 02 – Missing Critical Security Headers

## Observation
The website is missing multiple important HTTP security headers.

Overall SecurityHeaders Grade: F

Missing Headers:
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

The website is also served over HTTP without enforced HTTPS.

---

## Risk Explanation (Business Perspective)

Missing security headers increase exposure to:

- Clickjacking attacks
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- MIME-type sniffing attacks
- Data leakage via referrer headers
- Unauthorized browser feature access

Operating without HTTPS further exposes users to:

- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks
- Session hijacking
- Credential interception

This directly impacts customer trust and data protection.

## Risk Level
High

(Improper header configuration significantly weakens browser-level security controls.)

---

## Recommended Remediation

- Implement HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificate
- Configure Content-Security-Policy
- Enable X-Frame-Options (DENY or SAMEORIGIN)
- Enable X-Content-Type-Options (nosniff)
- Add Referrer-Policy
- Define Permissions-Policy

Regularly validate security headers using automated tools.
