## Identified Findings

| Finding ID | Title                              | Risk Level |
|------------|------------------------------------|------------|
| 01         | Public Service Exposure            | Low        |
| 02         | Missing Critical Security Headers  | High       |
| 03         | Insecure Session Cookie Configuration | High    |

---

## Overall Security Posture

Overall Risk Rating: **High**

While basic web service exposure is expected for public websites, the absence of critical security headers and improper session cookie configuration significantly weakens the application’s defensive posture.

Immediate remediation is recommended to reduce attack surface and improve user data protection.

## Business Impact Summary

If left unaddressed, the identified issues may lead to:

- Increased risk of session hijacking
- Exposure to client-side attacks (XSS, Clickjacking)
- Reduced customer trust
- Compliance and regulatory concerns
- Reputational damage

Security improvements should be prioritized to strengthen browser-level protections and session integrity.
