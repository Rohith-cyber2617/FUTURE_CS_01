# Finding 01 – Public Service Exposure

## Observation
The target website exposes an open HTTP service on Port 80.

## Technical Details
- Port: 80/tcp
- Service: HTTP
- Server Software: nginx 1.19.0
- Reverse DNS: ec2-44-228-249-3.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
- Hosting Environment: Amazon Web Services (EC2)

## Risk Explanation (Business Perspective)
An exposed web service is expected for public websites. However, publicly visible service and version information may allow attackers to:

- Identify known vulnerabilities associated with specific software versions
- Target misconfigurations
- Launch automated reconnaissance attacks

## Risk Level
Low

(This is expected exposure for a public website but still increases reconnaissance surface.)

## Recommended Remediation
- Ensure nginx version is up-to-date
- Disable unnecessary service banners
- Implement proper Web Application Firewall (WAF) controls
- Regularly monitor exposed services
